# Arduino-Bluetooth-Setup
This is a project that helps changing the display name, the pincode and baud rate to the Bluetooth JY-MCU (HC-06) module. It's really helpful the first time you use this module and you don't know the default settings.  It scans every baud rate and finds the one that it's currently in use. Then it sets it to the desired one.

##Usage
    //DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE IT ON YOUR PROJECT!!
    #include <BluetoothSetup.h>
